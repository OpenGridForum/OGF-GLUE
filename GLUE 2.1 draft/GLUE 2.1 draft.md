<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract</span>

The GLUE specification is an information model for Grid entities described using the natural language and UML Class Diagrams. As a conceptual model, it is designed to be independent from the concrete data models adopted for its implementation. This document extend the GLUE 2.0 model to include Cloud resources and services. Rendering to concrete data models such XML Schema, LDAP Schema and SQL are provided in a separate document.

[TOC]






## 1. Introduction

In this document, we present a conceptual information model for Grid and Cloud entities described using natural language and enriched with a graphical representation using UML Class Diagrams. As a conceptual model, it is designed to be independent from the concrete data models adopted for its implementation. Rendering to concrete data models such XML Schema, LDAP Schema, JSON schema and SQL are provided in a separate document. From the semantic viewpoint, the concrete data models SHOULD represent the same concepts and relationships of the conceptual information model; nevertheless they MAY contain simplifications targeted at improving query performance or other aspects of interest.

This information model is based on the experience of several modeling approaches being used in current production Grid infrastructures (e.g., GLUE Schema 1.x [GLUE-1.X], GLUE Schema 2.0 [GLUE-2.0], NorduGrid schema [NG-SCHEMA], Naregi model [NAREGI-SCHEMA]). The main supporting use cases are collected in the use cases document [GLUE-USECASES]. 

The mapping to concrete data models will be published in separate documents. Profile documents SHOULD appear to define how to generate and use the information in production scenarios or how to integrate the GLUE specification along with clarifications, refinements, interpretations and amplifications to promote interoperability (e.g., a profile MAY decide that an attribute which is optional in the conceptual model, is considered mandatory in a certain Grid infrastructure; or that optional attributes are never published).

## 3. Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",  and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). All class names are written using `this font`.



## 4. General Statements

The Information Model and its renderings MUST treat strings, both entity and attribute names and their values, as being case-sensitive. Each GLUE entity MUST have an ID attribute (an exception is made for the `Extension` class) which is needed for identification or for access to the attributes of the related entity over time and across different information sources. As a general guideline, ID's SHOULD be persistent at least for a day when assigned to an entity. The ID MUST NOT be interpreted by the user or the system as having any meaning other than an identifier. In particular, there is no relationship between an ID and a network endpoint. Every ID MUST be a valid URI. The usage of URN (Uniform Resource Name, a subset of Uniform Resource Identifier or URI) is RECOMMENDED. The motivations for choosing URI's reside in the fact that Grid services are evolving towards Web-based technologies, therefore it is meaningful to adopt the same identification system.

As regards units of measure, multiples of bytes MUST refer to the SI (_Le **S**ystème **I**nternational d'Unités_) prefix (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix), therefore GB is 10<sup>9</sup> Bytes and not 2<sup>30</sup> Bytes (the latter are GibiBytes).

In Appendix A, we provide guidelines for place-holder values that MUST be used when the attributes have no good default value or when the attribute cannot be measured for some reason.

 

As regards extensibility, two main approaches are introduced to extend the information associated to the existing classes: the OtherInfo attribute and the `Extension` class. The OtherInfo attribute is present in the `Entity` class, therefore it is inherited by all GLUE classes. Its type is string and its multiplicity is *. This SHOULD be used for associating a flat list of tags to a certain class instance. The `Extension` class is associated to the `Entity` class (and therefore also to all the derived classes) and enables to link key/value pairs to any GLUE class instance. This SHOULD be used when there is the need for advertising more structured information, for instance an attribute not present in the model with a related value. 

Both solutions are proposed because they have a different impact in the implementations: the OtherInfo approach is easier to query, nevertheless it MAY require parsing in case of concatenation of different chunks of information (e.g., attribute name and attribute value). The `Extension` class offers a two-dimensional construct, but nevertheless it is more complex to query.

The extensibility regarding the addition of new classes and associations is not supported at the conceptual level. We RECOMMEND to create specializations of the conceptual model and to implement them by extending the concrete data models. Such extensions MUST NOT be considered part of the GLUE specification, but nevertheless we RECOMMEND submitting them to the GLUE WG for consideration in future revisions of the specification.



## 5. Template

In order to enrich the UML Class Diagrams with additional information, a table for each UML class is provided.  This descriptive table is composed of three parts.  

The ﬁrst part refers to the whole entity and presents the entity name, the entity from which it inherits and the description of what the entity represents. 

The second part refers to the properties of the class; for each of them, the following characteristics are described: the attribute name, the data type, the multiplicity concerning how many values are allowed (* means zero or more), the unit of measurement and a description. For easy of reading, the properties that are inherited from a parent class are also listed. As regards the multiplicity, the value of zero means that it is allowed to refrain from publishing a value for the related attribute even though this MAY be measured. 

The third part refers to the associations (association, composition, aggregation or association class) that the class MAY hold with other classes.  For each association, the associated class reference is described in terms of the associated end class and key attribute, the multiplicity (i.e., the number of instances of the associated class that are allowed) and a description. The inherited associations are also reported in the "inherited association end" if they are not redefined in the "association end". The template structure is the following:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Entity
   </td>
   <td colspan="3" >Inherits from
   </td>
   <td>Description
   </td>

## 6. Conceptual Model of the Main Entities

This section introduces the main entities of the GLUE information model. They capture the core concepts relevant in a Grid environment. The main entities SHOULD be used to derive specialized information models. In Figure 1, the classes and the related relationships are presented in the form of a UML Class Diagram.


![Figure 1 Entities and relationships for the Main Entities conceptual model](images/glue2-1-draft-v0-5-doc0.png "Figure 1 Entities and relationships for the Main Entities conceptual model")


**Figure 1 Entities and relationships for the Main Entities conceptual model**



### 6.1 Entity

The `Entity` class is the root entity from which all the GLUE classes inherit (an exception is made for the `Extension` class). The specialized classes will inherit both the associations and the attributes of `Extension` class. The attributes CreationTime and Validity are metadata related to the generation and life of the information. The Name attribute allows a human-readable name to be provided for any object, usable for e.g. monitoring or diagnostic displays. The Name SHOULD NOT have any semantic interpretation.

   <td colspan="2" >The entity MAY be associated to zero or more key-value pairs.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>




### 6.2 Extension

The `Extension` class provides a general mechanism to add key/value pairs to GLUE classes when suitable specific attributes are not present. The creation time and validity of each `Extension` instance are those of the extended class instance.

   <td>An identifier local to the container class instance; typically an attribute name not present in the model. This identifier is not required to be unique; several instances of this class MAY hold the same value for this attribute.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

   </td>
   <td>String
   </td>

   </td>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td colspan="2" >The key/value pair is associated to an Entity instance.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>




### 6.3 Location

The `Location` class is introduced to model geographical locations where a certain `Domain` or `Service` are placed. The aim is to provide a simple way to express geographical information, and it is not intended to be used in complex geographical information systems. Due to different requirements, the granularity is not strictly defined and is left to the information producers depending on their needs. Hence the extent of a geographical location can vary from an exact position to a region spanning several different countries, not necessarily adjacent. The accuracy of the latitude and longitude attributes should be defined in an interoperability profile defined by projects adopting this specification.

   <td>Entity

   </td>
   <td>Description

### 6.4 Contact

The `Contact` class is introduced to represent contact information for different groups or expert roles responsible for aspects of the operation of services and domains (e.g., user support, security or sysadmin). The various types of contact are identified by the Type attribute. In case of time-dependent contact information (e.g., due to work on shifts), the instances of this entity should represent only the currently active contact information.  

The contact information SHOULD be encoded as a URI. There are several specifications recommending how to embed contacts into a URI. The following specifications SHOULD be used:



*   telephone and fax: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt
*   email: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2368.txt
*   irc: http://www.w3.org/Addressing/draft-mirashi-url-irc-01.txt

The `AdminDomain` class is introduced to model a collection of actors that manage a number of services. An `AdminDomain` MAY be associated to both `Contact` and `Location` class instances in order to provide contact information and geographical location respectively. An `AdminDomain` MAY be composed by other `AdminDomains` in a hierarchical structure. This structure MAY represent a "participates in" association.

 #### 6.5.2 UserDomain

The `UserDomain` class SHOULD be used to capture the concept of a Virtual Organization (VO). By VO, we mean a set of individuals and/or institutions having direct access to computers, software, data, and other resources for collaborative problem-solving or other purposes. Resources utilized by a VO are expected to be accessible via network endpoints and constrained by defined utilization targets called shares. The VO MAY exhibit its internal structure in terms of groups of individuals, each of them constituting a `UserDomain`. `UserDomains` MAY be hierarchically structured. The "participates in" association MAY represent this structure.

As regards the UserManager attribute, it is RECOMMENDED that its value is an Endpoint ID enabling discovery of the related `Service` class instance and associated attributes. An example of a User Manager would be an endpoint for a VOMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOMS) server. 



 ### 6.6 Service

One of the main goals of the GLUE information model is to enable the discovery of the Grid capabilities available in a certain infrastructure. Based on the use cases and modeling experience, a number of concepts were identified as general building blocks: `Endpoint`, `Share`, `Manager`, `Resource. `The` Service` class enables the unique identification of instances of these concepts participating in the provision of some unified capability.  The` Service` class SHOULD be also used to characterize this overall capability.

The Service is autonomous and denotes a weak aggregation among Endpoints, the underlying Managers and the related Resources, and the defined Shares. The Service enables the identification of this whole set of entities providing the functionality with a persistent name.

A simple `Service` aggregates an `Endpoint`, no `Share`, no `Manager` and no `Resource` (e.g., a metadata catalogue service). In the context of a `Service` class, the same `Resource` MAY be exposed via multiple `Endpoints` based on the defined `Shares`.  For instance, in the area of storage systems, two `Endpoints` implementing SRMv1 [SRMV1] and SRMv2.2 [SRMV2] interfaces respectively MAY expose the same `Resource` via different `Endpoints` offering different interface versions; in the area of computing systems, the CREAM [cream] and GRAM [GRAM] `Endpoints` MAY expose the `Resources` locally managed by the same `Manager` (typically a batch system). `Endpoints,` `Shares`, `Managers `and `Resources` MUST belong to precisely one Service.



### 6.7 Endpoint

The `Endpoint` class models a network location that can be contacted to access certain functionalities based on a well-defined interface. The defined attributes refer to aspects such as the network location, the exposed interface name and version, the details of the implementation, the functional state and the scheduled downtime.

For Grid services requiring a richer set of attributes for the `Endpoint`, specific models MAY be derived by specializing from the `Endpoint` class and adding new properties or relationships. The current proposal contains the `ComputingEndpoint` specialization (see Section 8.2) and the `StorageEndpoint` specialization (see Section 9.4).

The network location of an endpoint MUST be encoded in a URI. When available, standard schemes for the encoding SHOULD be used (e.g., as used for the Java Messaging Service http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-merrick-jms-uri-03.txt).

Concerning the SupportedProfile attribute, if there is no recommended URI for the identification of a certain profile, then the following options SHALL be considered: (1) use the main URL of the document specifying the profile, or (2) use the target namespace URI (in case of an XML Schema representation of the profile).



### 6.8 Share

The `Share` class is an abstract entity that MUST NOT be instantiated; it SHOULD be used in order to derive specialized entities. At this level, it is introduced to capture the concept of a utilization target, that is a constrained usage of service functionalities or resources that MAY be created based on aspects such as identify or UserDomain membership, usage information or resource characteristics.

### 6.9 Manager

The `Manager` class is an abstract entity that MUST NOT be instantiated; it SHOULD be used in order to derive specialized entities. At this level, it is introduced to capture the characteristics of a local software layer (not directly exposed via an Endpoint) which has control of the underlying resources. The functionalities of a manager layer that need to be accessible by remote users are typically abstracted by a middleware component via a standard interface, and are modeled by the concept of `Endpoint.` Examples of managers are: for computing resources, batch systems such as OpenPBS or LSF; for storage resources, GPFS or HPSS.

### 6.10 Resource

The `Resource` class is an abstract entity that MUST NOT be instantiated; it SHOULD be used in order to derive specialized entities. It is introduced to identify and model hardware entities providing capabilities which are exposed via `Endpoints`. Examples are execution environments for computational activities or data stores for data.

### 6.11 Activity

The `Activity` class models units of work which are submitted to `Services` via `Endpoints`. Grid jobs, i.e. Computing Activities in GLUE, are example of `Activities` for a Computing Service. An interesting type of relationship for jobs derives from their propagation through several `Services`. For instance, a broker `Service` submits a Grid job to a selected execution `Service;` upon completion the execution `Service` submits a logging record to an accounting `Service`. Each of these `Services` may have associated an instance of a Grid `Activity` related to the lifecycle of the job within the service. All instances refer to the same conceptual job submitted by the user.

### 6.12 Policy

The `Policy` class is an abstract entity that MUST NOT be instantiated; it SHOULD be used in order to derive specialized entities. This class is introduced to model statements, rules or assertions that define the correct or expected behavior of entities. Two specializations are introduced: `AccessPolicy` related to `Endpoints` and `MappingPolicy` related to `Shares`.

For a given entity to which policies are associated (i.e., `Endpoint` and `AccessPolicy`, `Share` and `MappingPolicy`), several instances of the `Policy` class MAY be defined. This is allowed in order to enable the advertisement of policies using different schemes. We RECOMMEND that only one instance per policy scheme is associated to the same entity instance. The evaluation algorithm for the rules SHOULD be defined by the policy scheme.

If an entity instance is associated to different `Policy` instances, each of them based on a different scheme, then the evaluation process SHOULD consider each set of policies independently. This means that the evaluation SHOULD rely on a certain policy scheme which is selected and understood by the consumer, and not by composing policies expressed using different schemes.

In this document, we provide the definition for a "basic" scheme (see Appendix B.37). Such a scheme is designed to be simple and is inspired by real world scenarios in current production Grid systems. The Rule attribute implicitly contains a reference to the associated User Domains; therefore, in the concrete data model mapping, we RECOMMEND to not represent the association between User Domain and Access Policy or Mapping Policy explicitly since it is already captured by the Rule.

More complex schemes MAY be defined in profile documents describing the usage of the schema in particular Grid infrastructures.

The published `Policies` do not represent a contract, and hence the associated `Service` is not bound to honour the decisions implied by the published rules. In addition the published rules may be expressed at a coarse granularity, which may be modified internally by more finely-grained rules which are not published. However, the published rules SHOULD match the decisions which will be made in practice in a substantial majority of cases.

#### 6.12.1 AccessPolicy

The `AccessPolicy` class is a specialization of the `Policy` class. This entity MAY be used to express authorization rules, e.g.  which `UserDomains` MAY access a certain service `Endpoint`. The granularity of these policies SHOULD be coarse-grained and suitable for pre-selection of services. The actual decision on the service side is performed by an authorization component that MAY contain a finer-grained set of policy rules that in some case MAY contradict the published coarse-grained policy rules. The default policy is assumed to be to deny access, hence `Endpoints `for which there are no matching Rules SHOULD NOT be selected for possible use.

Examples of actors involved in this entity are `UserDomains` representing VOs or groups.

#### 6.12.2 MappingPolicy

The `MappingPolicy` class is a specialization of the `Policy` class. This entity MAY be used to express which `UserDomains` MAY consume a certain share of resources. The granularity of these policies SHOULD be coarse-grained and suitable for pre-selection of services. The actual decision on the service side is performed by an authorization component that MAY contain a finer-grained set of policy rules that in some case MAY contradict the published coarse-grained policy rules.

Conceptually, the union of all the `MappingPolicy` rules should match the corresponding `AccessPolicy `rules, i.e. any authorised` UserDomain `will be mapped to at least one `Share. `However, publication of` Shares `is OPTIONAL, and hence there MAY be no` Share `with a matching` MappingPolicy `rule. In this case a consumer SHOULD NOT make any assumption about the properties of the `Share `to which it will be mapped. Conversely, the published `MappingPolicy `rules MAY not have a corresponding` AccessPolicy`, in which case the implication is that there is some unpublished access method enabling access to the associated Share.

When evaluating the mapping to a certain `Share` using the algorithm implied by the policy scheme, if multiple solutions are available then the consumer SHOULD NOT make any assumption about which `Share` will be assigned to its `Activity,` and if it requires a specific `Share` it SHOULD request that `Share` explicitly.

## 7. Conceptual Model of the Computing Service

The conceptual model of the Computing Service is based on the main entities and uses specializations of the `Service`, `Endpoint`, `Share`, `Manager`, `Resource`, and `Activity` entities.  Further computing related concepts such as `Application Environment`, `Application Handle` and `Benchmark` are introduced.


![Figure 2 Entities and relationships for the Computing Service conceptual model](images/glue2-1-draft-v0-5-doc1.png "Figure 2 Entities and relationships for the Computing Service conceptual model")
 

**Figure 2 Entities and relationships for the Computing Service conceptual model**

In this section, we extensively use the concepts of physical CPU, logical CPU and slot defined as follows:



*   a physical CPU is defined by a socket on a motherboard, i.e. there is one physical CPU per socket (e.g., a multi-core CPU counts as one physical CPU);
*   a logical CPU corresponds to a CPU as visible by the operating system running either on a real or virtual machine (e.g. a four-core CPU counts as four logical CPUs);
*   a slot is a portion of executable time in a logical CPU offered by an execution environment instance which MAY be occupied by a job:
    *   typically there is one slot per logical CPU, but a logical CPU MAY be shared among multiple slots;
    *   jobs MAY occupy several slots at the same time (e.g., MPI jobs); a multi-slot job is counted as one `Activity`.

Throughout the specification, we also use the concept of storage extent to mean the capabilities and management of the various media that exist to store data and allow data retrieval.



## 7.1 ComputingService

 \
The `ComputingService` class is a specialization of the `Service` class for a service offering computational capacity. The `ComputingService` entity is the main logical unit, and aggregation point for several entities together modeling a computing capability in a Grid system. A `ComputingService` is capable of executing `ComputingActivities` on its associated resources. The resources behind the `ComputingService` are described via the `ComputingManager`, `ExecutionEnvironment`, `ApplicationEnvironment`, `ApplicationHandle` and `Benchmark` entities. The governing policies and status of the resources are given by the `ComputingShare` elements. The `ComputingActivities` of a `ComputingService` are submitted and controlled via a `ComputingEndpoint`.

The computing service is autonomous and denotes a weak aggregation among Computing Endpoints, the underlying Computing Managers and related Execution Environments, and the defined Computing Shares. The Computing Service enables the identification of the whole set of entities providing the computing functionality with a persistent name.

A simple `Computing Service` is formed by a `Computing Endpoint` exposing an interface for job submission and control. In the case of a single `Computing Manager` whose `Execution Environments` are exposed by multiple `Computing Endpoints`, the `Computing Manager`, `Execution Environments` and `Computing Endpoints` MUST be considered as part of the same `Computing Service`. In the case of a single `Computing Endpoint` exposing `Execution Environments` managed by different `Computing Managers`, then the `Computing Endpoint`, the `Execution Environments` and the related `Computing Managers` MUST be considered as part of the same `Computing Service`. 

The `Computing Service` always aggregates `Computing Endpoints`, `Computing Shares`, `Computing Managers` and `Execution Environments` forming a connected set. In other words, `Endpoint` A exposing `Execution Environment` A of `Manager` A via `Share` A and `Endpoint` B exposing `Execution Environment` B of `Manager` B via `Share` B form two different `Computing Services`. On the other hand, `Endpoint` A exposing `Execution` `Environment` A of `Manager` A via `Share` A and `Endpoint` B exposing `Execution Environment `A of `Manager` A via `Share` B form a single `Computing Service`. 



### 7.2 ComputingEndpoint

The `ComputingEndpoint` is a specialization of the `Endpoint` class for a service possessing computational capability. The class represents an endpoint which is used to create, control and monitor computational activities. The computational-specific information concerns service load related parameters, staging capabilities and supported types of job description. This class provides attributes that MAY be used to publish summary information about jobs submitted via a particular Endpoint. Such attributes are optional and may not always be measurable (e.g., in the case of a stateless Endpoint which does not keep information about the jobs submitted through it).

### 7.3 ComputingShare

The `ComputingShare` class is the specialization of the main `Share` class for computational services. A Computing Share is a high-level concept introduced to model a utilization target for a set of Execution Environments defined by a set of configuration parameters and characterized by status information. A `ComputingShare` carries information about "policies" (limits) defined over all or a subset of resources and describes their dynamic status (load). 

 \
In clusters managed by a batch system (LRMS), the simplest way to set up a Computing Share is to configure a batch queue. Nevertheless, the same Computing Share may be implemented using different batch system configuration strategies. In complex batch systems, a batch queue may be configured with different sets of policies for different sets of users. This implies that each set of users obtains a different utilization target. Such a scenario MAY be represented by different Computing Shares. In general, given a number of shares to be set up, it is possible to adopt different configuration strategies in the underlying system. Regardless of the selected approach, the external behavior does not change. The main goal of the Computing Share concept is to abstract from such implementation choices and to represent the externally observable behavior.  \
 \
The introduction of the Computing Share concept also supports the modelling of heterogeneity within a `ComputingService` by being able to have associations to different Execution Environments.

As regards CPU Time and Wallclock Time related properties, there is a need to have a way to normalize them depending on the computing capacity of the Execution Environment. The approach proposed in GLUE is to add two attributes in the Execution Environment (see Section 7.8) which refer to the scaling factor to be used to compute the CPU/Wallclock time limit that a job will get if it will be assigned to such an Execution Environment via a certain Share. It is important that a job SHOULD always get at least the advertised CPU/Wallclock time. This means that the reference Execution Environment for the normalization should be always the fastest (most powerful) among those available in the entire Computing Service. For this Execution Environment, the scaling factor MUST be equal to 1. The CPU/Wallclock time values published by a Share therefore refer to the time limit that the job will get when mapped to this Execution Environment. For the other Execution Environments, the time should be adjusted according to the published scaling factors.



### 7.4 ComputingShareAcceleratorInfo

The ComputingShareAcceleratorInfo class contains all the information about the usage level of  the accelerator device bound to the computing share.

### 7.5 ComputingManager

The `ComputingManager` class is a specialization of the `Manager` class for the computational capability. The `ComputingManager` is responsible for the local control of resources, and this layer is not exposed directly to external clients. The operating system might be the simplest case of a Computing Manager, but the `ComputingManager` is often realized by means of a Local Resource Management (LRMS) "batch" system. A Computing Service will usually only have one Computing Manager, but MAY have more. The class provides aggregated information on controlled resources, and also describes local storage extents accessible to jobs.

  <tr>
   <td>A working area local to each Execution Environment and dedicated to each job.

</table>


In case there is a dedicated working area for multi-slot jobs, this SHOULD be represented by the WorkingAreaMultiSlot* attributes. In case there is no dedicated working area for multi-slot jobs, i.e., there is a common working area for both single-slot and multi-slot jobs, we RECOMMEND to publish only the attributes related to the working area for single-slot jobs.

### 7.8 ExecutionEnvironment

The `ExecutionEnvironment` class describes the hardware and operating system environment in which a job will run. It represents a set of homogeneous Worker Nodes, so if a computing system contains nodes with significantly different properties there MAY be several `ExecutionEnvironment` instances. This implies that it should be possible to request a specific environment when a job is submitted. The `ExecutionEnvironment` MAY refer to virtual rather than physical machines.

As well as attributes describing a typical node, the class gives summary information about the size and usage of the set of nodes which possess those properties. However, there is no way to relate these to the information in other entities, e.g. it is not possible to know which jobs in a given `ComputingShare` are running on which `ExecutionEnvironment`.

Each Execution Environment instance is under the control of a Computing Manager (i.e., LRMS). An Execution Environment MAY be realized in several ways. Examples are a physical computing node, or a virtual machine image that MAY be requestable by a job (different virtual machine images MAY coexist on the same physical node). 



#### 7.8.1 AcceleratorEnvironment

The AcceleratorEnvironment is an entity used to describe an homogeneous set of accelerator processors. This entity is associated with one or more execution environments.

### 7.9 ApplicationEnvironment

The `ApplicationEnvironment` class describes the software environment in which a job will run, i.e. what pre-installed software will be available to it. Each Application is identified by a name (the AppName attribute); these names are not defined within the schema, but SHOULD be assigned in a way which allows applications to be uniquely identified. In some deployment scenarios, the definition of namespace-based AppNames or guidelines for the generation of unique application names MAY be specified, and application repository services relying on those application names MAY be provided. This aspect is considered out of scope for the GLUE schema specification, but MAY be included in a profile document for a specific production Grid.

The Application Environment can be used to describe installed application software or special environment setups in terms of a simple tag string. In this case, the AppName attribute should be used to publish this tag; other attributes are optional.

The properties of installed software may vary substantially, but the attributes of the class cover the most common cases, in particular for licensed software. If necessary, additional information MAY be added using the `OtherInfo` attribute and the `Extension` class.

### 7.10 ApplicationHandle

The `ApplicationHandle` class is an extension to `ApplicationEnvironment` for applications which need to be set up in some way before they can be used. For each supported setup method a string MAY be specified, the interpretation of which is specific to the method - in the simplest case this could just be a setup script to execute. A single Application MAY support multiple setup methods.

In this specification, the Computing Activity may refer to simple jobs, or to elements of collections or workflows. The description of the relationships between jobs which are part of a collection or workflow may be considered in future revisions of the specification. 

As regards the State attribute and the related ComputingActivityState_t type, we note that currently there is no commonly accepted state model for Grid jobs. Each production Grid middleware defines and is using its own state model. As regards the standardization process, the OGSA-BES specification defines a simple state model. The middleware providers have started to define their own extensions to the BES state model, but they differ and do not enable interoperability. Given the current scenario, we RECOMMEND to use namespaces in state model values, so that every middleware provider MAY publish the Computing Activity State according to its definition. We expect that an extension to the core BES state model common to all the middleware providers and suitable for production scenarios may be defined by a profiling activity of the BES/ JSDL/GLUE specifications.



### 7.12 ToStorageService

The `ToStorageService` class represents the case where a filesystem from a Storage Service is available to jobs running on a Computing Service via POSIX access, e.g. as an NFS mount. Each `ToStorageService` instance represents a single mount point. It is assumed that such mounts are available on all nodes (i.e. all Execution Environments) in the Computing Service.

## 8. Conceptual Model of the Cloud Computing Service

The conceptual model of the Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Compute Service is based on the main entities and uses specializations of the `Service`, `Endpoint`, `Share`, `Manager` and `Resource`.  Further cloud computing related concepts such as `Compute Image`, `Compute Price` and `Benchmark` are introduced. 


![Figure 3 Entities and relationships for the Cloud Compute Service conceptual model](images/glue2-1-draft-v0-5-doc2.png "Figure 3 Entities and relationships for the Cloud Compute Service conceptual model")


**Figure 3 Entities and relationships for the Cloud Compute Service conceptual model.**

In this section, we extensively use the concepts of Virtual Machine (VM), Virtual Machine status (halted, pending, running, suspended), Hypervisor and Cloud Middleware, these are defined as follows:



*   A Virtual Machine (instance) is a compute environment that includes a platform operating system and an application layer. Every VM is a fully functioning virtual computer which can be accessed via the network. The VM has a given set of virtual CPU, RAM and disk resources. The main virtual disk is usually associated to a pre-set disk image, which contains the operating system to boot in the machine. The VM has usually one or more virtual network interfaces, to which are assigned public or private IPs.
*   A Virtual Machine is in Running state when the VM is actively consuming system resources in terms of RAM, CPU, disk and network. Some of the physical resources may be shared with other VMs or reserved for private VM usage.
*   A Virtual Machine is in Suspended state when the VM is not running, but it still has resources reserved on the system. A VM in suspended state usually consumes only disk space for the OS, and optionally additional disk space for RAM snapshot.
*   A Virtual Machine is in Pending state when the VM is in the process of gathering resources from the system (ex. acquiring VM OS disk, CPU resources, initializing syste). Machines in Pending state uses system resources but are not jet available for users to access.
*   A Virtual Machine is in Halted state when the VM has uses no resources in the system, but its template and configuration is still stored into the system (so the machine may be started again, but with a clean configuration).
*   An Hypervisor, usual name for Virtual Machine Manager, is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates, runs and manages Virtual Machines
*   A Cloud Middleware is a piece of computer software that leverages on hypervisor virtualization capabilities to provide Virtual Machines on-demand to final users. The Cloud Middleware may provide not only virtual servers (namely Infrastructure as a Service feature), but also storage (Storage as a Service) and other rich services (Platform as a Service, etc…).

Throughout the specification, we also use the concept of Cloud Storage extent to mean the capabilities and management of the various media that exist to store data and allow data retrieval.

In the model, the Cloud service price is represented via separated `CloudComputingPrice` entities associated to single accounted resources (eg. CPU, Memory, Disk, Network IN/OUT, Software Licensing). Each resource price is calculated on consumption or fixed fee basis and targeted to a give user base (eg. commercial, no-profit organizations, research). The total price for a `CloudComputingInstance` can be obtained by adding all the price elements from the associated `CloudComputingImage` and `CloudComputingInstanceType`.

A Cloud Computing service relates directly to a Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) system, which allows the user to run on-demand Virtual Appliances for computing purposes. For different Cloud computing services such as Platoform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service, the generic Grid platform computing model (GLUE2 Computing entities), bed in Chapter 7, may be a better fit.



### 8.1 CloudComputingService

 \
The `CloudComputingService` class is a specialization of the `Service` class for a service offering Cloud Infrastructure as a Service computational capacity. The `CloudComputingService` entity is the main logical unit, and aggregation point for several entities together modeling a computing infrastructure capability in a Cloud system. A `CloudComputingService` is capable of executing `CloudComputingInstance` on its associated resources. The resources behind the `CloudComputingService` are described via the `CloudComputingManager`, `CloudComputingInstanceType`, `CloudComputingImage` and `Benchmark` entities. The governing policies and status of the resources are given by the `CloudComputingShare` elements. The `CloudComputingInstance` of a `CloudComputingService` are submitted and controlled via a `CloudComputingEndpoint`.

<p>

The Computing Service enables the identification of the whole set of entities providing the computing functionality with a persistent name.

A simple `CloudComputingService` is formed by a `CloudComputingEndpoint` exposing an interface for VM instantiation and control. The `CloudComputingService` always aggregates `CloudComputingEndpoints`, `CloudComputingShares`, `CloudComputingManagers`, `CloudComputingImage` and `CloudComputingInstanceType` forming a connected set. In other words, `Endpoint` A exposing `InstanceType` A and `Image` A served by `Manager` A via `Share` A and `Endpoint` B exposing `InstanceType` B and `Image` B served by `Manager` B via `Share` B form two different `Computing Services`. On the other hand, `Endpoint` A exposing `InstanceType` A and `Image` A served by `Manager` A via `Share` A and `Endpoint` B exposing `InstanceType` A and `Image` A served by `Manager` A via `Share` B form a single `Computing Service`.



### 8.2 CloudComputingEndpoint

The `CloudComputingEndpoint` is a specialization of the `Endpoint` class for a service possessing cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service capability. The class represents an endpoint which is used to create, control and monitor Cloud computing activities. The specific information concerns service status and interface capabilities. This class provides attributes that MAY be used to publish summary information about VM instantiated via a particular Endpoint. Such attributes are optional and may not always be measurable (e.g., in the case of a stateless Endpoint which does not keep information about the VM instantiated through it).

### 8.3 CloudComputingShare

The `CloudComputingShare` class is the specialization of the main `Share` class for cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service. A `CloudComputingShare` is a high-level concept introduced to model a utilization target for a pool of resources, sometimes referred as Zones or Sites, defined by a homogeneous set of configuration parameters and characterized by single status information. A `CloudComputingShare` carries information about "policies" (limits) defined over all or a subset of resources and describes their dynamic status (load).

The `CloudComputingShare` stores also a set of `CloudComputingImage` and `CloudComputingInstanceType`, which are used to define respectively the virtual OS and the virtual hardware resources of the `CloudComputingInstance` running on the share. Such virtual OS and hardware resources are provided by the Share with a given Service Level Agreement (SLA). In case of the same `CloudComputingInstanceType` and `CloudComputingImage` are offered under different SLAs, multiple `CloudComputingShare`s shall be created, one for each SLA.

### 8.5 CloudComputingManager

The `CloudComputingManager` class is a specialization of the `Manager` class for the computational capability (Virtual Machines) manager. The `CloudComputingManager` is responsible for the local control of resources. The `CloudComputingManager` layer is not exposed directly to external clients or to the Virtual Machines themselves.

The Virtual Machine manager is usually referred as Hypervisor, thus a piece of software, firmware or hardware which creates, runs and manages Virtual Machines. A Compute Service will usually have only one Compute Manager, but MAY have more. The class provides aggregated information on controlled resources, hypervisors limits and also describes local storage extents accessible to the Virtual Machines.

### 8.7 CloudComputingInstanceType

The `CloudComputingInstanceType `class describes the hardware environment of the VM, i.e. the amount of RAM, CPU, disk and network resources the VM OS will see and manage. The resources provided to the VM are virtual resources, usually shared with other VMs running in the same infrastructure. The performances of the provided resources are specified via the Benchmarks associated to the Instance Type.

### 8.8 CloudComputingImage

The `CloudComputingImage` class describes the software environment of the VM, i.e. which OS is booting at VM startup and which pre-installed software is available on it. Each application installed on the OS is identified by a name (the InstalledSoftware attribute); these names are not defined within the schema, but SHOULD be assigned in a way which allows applications to be uniquely identified. In some deployment scenarios, the definition of namespace-based InstalledSoftware or guidelines for the generation of unique application names MAY be specified, and application repository services relying on those application names MAY be provided. This aspect is considered out of scope for the GLUE schema specification, but MAY be included in a profile document for a specific production Clouds.

The `CloudComputingImage` can be used to describe specific OS features, particular OS configuration, installed application software or special environment setups in terms of a simple tag string. In this case, the InstalledSoftware attribute should be used to publish this tag.

The properties of installed software may vary substantially, but the attributes of the class cover the most common cases, in particular for licensed software. If necessary, additional information MAY be added using the `OtherInfo` attribute and the `Extension` class.

The OS template may require a certain amount of resources (CPU, RAM and GPU) to run. These requirements are specified in terms of minimum and recommended requirements, which will lead the user to the proper selection of virtual resources needed by the VM.

The price item linked to this entity represent a single price voice of the final bill, usually related to OS or applicantion licensing price. The linked price values need to be added to the prices in the `CloudComputingInstanceType` to determinate the final price associated to an active instance.

The OS disk size specified in the `CloudComputingImage` is the minimum disk size who need to be provided by the `CloudComputingInstanceType` for a VM to be instantiated correctly. If the `CloudComputingInstanceType` has no OS disk size associated, the VM OS disk size will be the one specified by the `CloudComputingImage`, otherwise, the VM OS disk will be enlarged to the size specified by the `CloudComputingInstanceType`.

    1.  CloudServicePrice

The `CloudServicePrice` entity models the resources price in the cloud environment. This entity represents a single price voice of the final price for the activity. This voice is related to a given consumed resource which is specified in the attributes of the entity.

The price for the given resource is represented by a fixed price or consumption model. The fixed price is independent on the resource usage and can be billed once or multiple times during the life of the Computing Activity (ex. Monthly fixed prices). The consumption price need to be multiplied by the accounted resource consumption value (present in the Computing Activity entity) in the given consumption period. Consumption prices must be specified in the same unit as per the unit of the accounted resource.

Different costs models may be applied to different users according to the scope of the Computing Activity. For example, research usage may have different pricing respect to commercial one. The related scope for the price to apply is described in the entity attributes. 

With the information provided by the Scope attribute, this entity MAY be used in alternative to `User Domain` and `Access Policy` entities, to discriminate which category of users have access to the resource. In this view, it MAY be defined by the user community that users category without associated cost entity for the service have no access to it.

The entity can be associated to multiple `CloudComputingInstanceType` or `CloudComputingImage` or `StorageService`, but not to different class of entities at the same time.



    1.  CloudToStorageService

The `CloudToStorageService` class represents the case where a virtual disk is created into the Storage Service for VM usage. The disk may be attached to the VM (visible as a disk device by the VM OS) or available via other export protocols (NFS share, iSCSI, etc…).

The attributes of this entity refer to the link of the storage resource into the Storage System and the VM environment.

The entity can be associated to multiple `CloudComputingInstance`, to a` CloudComputingImage` or to both the entities at the same time. The disk may also be temporary un-associated to any Computing entity. This is the case of data which has been detached from all the running VMs but stays available to be attached to new VMs.



1.  **Conceptual Model of the Storage Service**

The conceptual model of the Storage Service is based on the main entities and uses specializations of the `Service`, `Endpoint`, `Share`, `Manager`, `Resource`, and `Activity` entities.  Further storage-related concepts such as `Storage Service Capacity`, `Storage Share Capacity` and `Storage Access Protocol` are also introduced.

**Figure 4 Entities and relationships for the Storage Service conceptual model**

As explained in Section , we use the concept of storage extent to mean the capabilities and management of the various media that exist to store data and allow data retrieval.



    1.  StorageService

A `StorageService` represents a storage system, most often hosted by a single site, but possibly distributed over multiple sites. A `StorageService` makes `StorageShares` of given properties available to selected `UserDomains`, typically (not necessarily) through one or more explicitly identified `StorageEndpoints`.  Data may be stored in or retrieved from `StorageShares` through one or more `StorageAccessProtocols`.  A `StorageShare` is a composition of extents from one or more `DataStores`.  `StorageShares` MAY overlap, i.e. map to the same underlying extent.  A `DataStore` represents a physical device that holds data (e.g. a disk farm or a tape robot).  Each `DataStore` is managed by a `StorageManager`, an instance of a particular software product identified by the ProductName and ProductVersion. `StorageServiceCapacity` objects summarize capacity-related information, for which details may be available associated to `StorageShares` and `DataStores`.

The Storage Service MAY expose Storage Endpoints enabling management of or access to different types of storage extent. The usage of storage is typically constrained by policies, thus implying service differentiation. The Storage Share concept describes a portion of the managed storage extents with a homogeneous set of usage policies. The storage extents used to implement the Shares are locally managed by one or more Storage Managers, and their properties are described by Data Stores.



    1.  StorageServiceCapacity

The `StorageServiceCapacity` class summarizes capacity-related information for all the `StorageShares` and `DataStores` of a given homogeneous type. The summaries MAY be compared to the sums of the relevant `StorageShareCapacity` attributes for the `StorageShares` of the given type.  Capacities of overlapping `StorageShares` MUST only be counted once.  An inconsistency between a summary value and the corresponding sum of relevant attributes MAY occur if part of the capacity is not explicitly published, or if the attributes concerned could not all be exactly determined or recorded at the same time.  The summaries MAY also be compared to the sums of the relevant attributes of the `DataStores` of the given type, where inconsistencies MAY arise due to similar causes.

    1.  StorageAccessProtocol

A `StorageAccessProtocol` describes a protocol that can be used to store data in or retrieve data from `StorageShares`. The "file" protocol indicates that for `ComputingServices` given by `ToComputingService` objects the `StorageShares` are available through POSIX I/O.  The mount point details are given by corresponding `ToStorageService` objects published by those `ComputingServices`. Most protocols require a negotiation between the client and a `StorageEndpoint`.  For example, a `StorageEndpoint` implementing a version of the SRM protocol may be asked for a data transfer URL corresponding to a desired access protocol.  An access protocol that does not require prior negotiation MAY be published as one or more `StorageEndpoints` with an InterfaceName corresponding to that protocol.

If a type of Storage Access Protocol needs to be discoverable, then the `StorageAccessProtocol` class SHOULD be used to advertise it. If a certain Access Protocol 

has an associated URL and this URL needs to be discoverable, then the Access Protocol SHOULD be also published via the `StorageEndpoint` class.



    1.  StorageEndpoint

A `StorageEndpoint` represents a service that may be contacted by clients to manage `StorageShares`, to store or retrieve data or to perform other operations related to a storage system.  The `StorageEndpoint` typically implements a storage control protocol specified by the InterfaceName, which allows for the manipulation of `StorageShares` and the properties of their data content.  Access to `StorageShares` for storing or retrieving data often has to be negotiated through the given control protocol.  The available access protocols MAY be published in `StorageAccessProtocol` objects.  The `StorageEndpoint` interface MAY also be used to publish the endpoint(s) of an access protocol that does not require prior negotiation.  The Storage Endpoint may be able to serve only a subset of the `StorageShares` within the `StorageService`, in which case that subset MAY be indicated through explicit associations with those `StorageShares`.

    1.  StorageShare

A `StorageShare` is a composition of extents from one or more `DataStores`. `StorageShares` that overlap, i.e. share the same underlying extent, have the same SharingID, which in that case MUST neither be empty nor the reserved string "dedicated".  A `DataStore` represents a physical device or set of devices that are able to hold data (e.g. a disk farm or a tape robot).  A `StorageShare` need not be composed of homogeneous devices.

The AccessLatency gives the maximum latency category for a object stored in the StorageShare to be made available for reading.  For example, if the `StorageShare` comprises both disk and tape storage, and data may need to be recalled from tape, the published AccessLatency is "nearline", although a given data object may in fact be immediately accessible on disk.

The RetentionPolicy indicates at a coarse granularity the probability of the `StorageShare` losing data.  For example, "custodial" represents a very low probability, while "replica" indicates that the `StorageShare` is not suitable for keeping the only copy of precious data, but may be used for keeping a replica of such data.

The ExpirationMode indicates what happens to data whose lifetime has expired, if ever.  The Identifier allows the `StorageShare` to be given a tag that is meaningful for the UserDomain(s) served by the `StorageShare`.  For example, for version 2.2 of the SRM control protocol a `StorageShare` would represent a Space and the Identifier the corresponding SpaceTokenUserDescription. Capacity-related information is made available through `StorageShareCapacity` objects.  A `StorageShare` may not be available through `StorageEndpoints` not explicitly related to the Share.

A Storage Share represents a utilization target of one or more storage extents with a set of policies which are homogeneous. If many User Domains are mapped to a Storage Share via a Mapping Policy, then they are assumed to be able to use the Share uniformly. A Storage Share MAY have many types of Storage Capacity. The usage of each type of Storage Capacity is described by the StorageShareCapacity class.



    1.  StorageShareCapacity

The `StorageShareCapacity` class provides a set of attributes related to the size of the data storage extents  associated with a `StorageShare`. One `StorageShare` MAY have several associated `StorageShareCapacity` objects of different types, which may be related either to the physical nature of the storage medium or to the intended use, e.g. accounting or resource discovery. It is therefore possible that the same physical storage MAY be reported in more than one object. The size information generally relates to the values as seen by a user of the `Service`, which may not correspond directly to the size of the physical storage media which underly it. For example, disk servers may include parity disks or hot spares which are not directly visible to users.

The semantics of this class are the same as the `StorageServiceCapacity` class which represent the size of the entire `Storage Service`, but the classes are different since the relations are different. In general it cannot be assumed that the `Storage Service Capacity` is the sum of all the corresponding `Storage Share Capacities`, both because some information at the `Share` level MAY not be published, and because multiple `StorageShare` objects MAY share the same physical storage. There may also be differences in timing or accuracy in the underlying services which collect the information.

The Storage Share Capacity is useful to express the usage information of a homogenous storage extent allocated to a Share. Such usage information refers to use by the User Domains which are related to the Storage Share via Mapping Policies. 



    1.  StorageManager

The `StorageManager` class respresents the software system which manages the data storage media. If different media, e.g. tape and disk, are managed by different software systems there MAY be multiple `StorageManager` instances for a single `StorageService`. In some systems there may be a number of layers of software, but this cannot be represented. At present no attributes are defined beyond those inherited from the `Manager` entity, i.e. the Name and Version of the software product.

    1.  DataStore

The `DataStore` class represents the physical storage systems underlying the `Storage Service`. Typically there will be one `DataStore` instance for each homogeneous type of storage, e.g. tape and disk. However, multiple objects of the same Type MAY be published if the storage is segmented at a high level, e.g. if there are two separate robotic tape stores. The size information relates to the physical capacity of the storage media, which may differ from the values reported in the Capacity classes.

    1.  ToComputingService

The `ToComputingService` class describes a network connection between a `Storage Service` and a `Computing Service` which has a level of performance significantly better than the general WAN connection. It is assumed that such a connection applies to the entirety of those Services, i.e. to all Worker Nodes within the `Computing Service` and all storage within the `Storage Service`. However, the connection MAY depend on the Access Protocol used to transfer the data. Some Access Protocols may only be available from a restricted set of Computing Services, and this may also be published using the ToComputingService class.

    1.  ToCloudComputingService

The `ToCloudComputingService` class describes a network connection between a `Storage Service` and a `Cloud Computing Service` which has a level of performance significantly better than the general WAN connection. It is assumed that such a connection applies to the entirety of those Services, i.e. to all Virtual machines within the `Cloud Computing Service` and all storage objects within the `Cloud Storage Service`. However, the connection MAY depend on the Access Protocol used to transfer the data and to restrictions in data access to the data itself. Some Access Protocols may only be available from a restricted set of Compute Services, and this may also be published using the `ToCloudComputingService` class.

It is important to note that this entity applies only to a `CloudStorageService` which relates to a given `CloudComputingService` (ex. to provide EBS storage to an IaaS service), not to generic Cloud Storage service such as Storage-as-a-Service.

1.  **Relationship to OGF Reference Model**

In this section, we describe the integration of the GLUE information model with the OGF Reference Model [RM]. The reference model defines the concept of Grid Component. In GLUE, a root concept called Entity is defined. Such a root concept MAY be defined as a specialization of the GridComponent concept, that means that all properties are inherited by the GLUE classes. In Figure 5, we represent this relationship by a UML class diagram. 


![Figure 5 GLUE and Reference Model integration](images/glue2-1-draft-v0-5-doc4.png "Figure 5 GLUE and Reference Model integration")


**Figure 5 GLUE and Reference Model integration**



1.  **Security Considerations**

This section considers security implications when using the GLUE 2.0 conceptual model.  It follows the advice given in RFC-3552.

As the conceptual model of GLUE 2.0 provides limited scope for embedding security information many of these concerns listed here are delegated to the concrete data models and to the underlying software implementations.  Nonetheless, some points are independent of which concrete data model is employed so some discussion is appropriate.

When deploying an information service conforming to the GLUE 2.0 conceptual model, consideration should be given to the points discussed below.



    1.  Communication security

The GLUE conceptual model is independent of how information is stored and how that information is exchanged between agents.  Because of this, concern for communication security is largely delegated to the underlying concrete data model and software implementations.



        1.  Confidentiality

The GLUE conceptual model contains information that MAY be personal or confidential in nature.  Contact details and indications of end-user activity MAY fall into this category.

Conforming implementations should identify which components of the data should be considered confidential and appropriate precautions should be in place to safeguard against disclosure to unintended audiences.



        1.  Data integrity

The information within GLUE has many potential uses, from operational to accounting.  How accurate the information is MAY depend on many factors, including the integrity of software agents that publish data and the transport used to propagate information.

The software used to provide an information service MAY cache GLUE information. If so, the caches provide additional points where data integrity MAY be compromised.



        1.  Peer Entity authentication

No explicit description of the agents that publish information is included within the GLUE conceptual model. This prevents authentication information from being included within the abstract model.

In general, support for peer-entity authentication is delegated to the concrete data model or the underpinning software.  In many cases the agents will act on behalf of some AdminDomain; if so, elements of peer entity authentication (e.g., public/private key-pairs) MAY be included using the described schema extension mechanisms provided issues with data integrity are understood.



    1.  Non-repudiation

The GLUE conceptual model contains no explicit description of the publishing agents that provide GLUE information.  This prevents explicitly support for non-repudiation.  In many cases a set of publishing agents will provide information for Services in some AdminDomain.  If so, then it is the AdminDomain that asserts the non-repudiation of the data the publishing agents provide.

Non-repudiation MAY require information from whoever asserts the non-repudiation of the data; for example, a cryptographic certificate of some AdminDomain.  If the publishing agent is identified with an AdminDomain then this information MAY be included using the schema extension mechanisms of the AdminDomain (via OtherInfo or Extension). It is also possible for this information to be included in fields specific to the concrete data model or it MAY be provided outside of the GLUE conceptual model.

In addition, information MAY be published with corresponding non-repudiation information, such as a cryptographic signature. Signatures MAY be included using schema extensions (OtherInfo or

Extension) or MAY be included in fields specific to the concrete data model.



    1.  System security

The GLUE conceptual model intended use is to provide an abstract view of a grid system.  There are many processes that MAY make use of this information, each MAY depend on the GLUE conceptual model to undertake work.



        1.  Unauthorized usage

The GLUE conceptual model has no explicit description of end-users of the schema information and no explicit description of authorized usage.  In general, is assumed that any authorization controls for access to the GLUE information is provided by specific concrete bindings and software implementation.

It MAY be possible to identify a UserDomain with those agents authorised to use GLUE information and embed authorization information using described schema extension mechanisms, provided issues with data integrity are understood.



        1.  Inappropriate Usage

The GLUE conceptual model provides no mechanism for describing appropriate usage and does not include a data-processing model, so providing a description of inappropriate usage is considered out-of-scope.

Individual grids MAY describe what they consider appropriate usage of GLUE information and implement appropriate procedures to ensure this policy is enacted.



    1.  Specific attacks

RFC-3552 describes several specific attacks that MUST be considered. These are detailed below.



        1.  Eavesdropping

Some information described in the GLUE conceptual model MAY be sensitive in nature; this MAY include contact details and descriptions of user activity.  Appropriate care should be taken to prevent unintended access or disclosure to an unintended audience.



        1.  Replay

Grid operations MAY depend on information provided in the GLUE conceptual model.

If a system implementing the GLUE 2.0 conceptual model is susceptible to a replay attack then it is possible for part (possibly all) of the information in the conceptual model to be reverted to some previous state as seen by some (possible all) end users.  Please note that this is a specific case of the more general modification attack.

A replay attack MAY result in disrupted service.  If security attributes, such as authorization, are embedded within the GLUE conceptual model then a replay attack MAY result in inappropriate access to data. Underlying concrete models and software implementations should prevent replay attacks.



        1.  Message insertion

The ability to insert information is key to providing accurate information.  However, inserting incorrect information MAY have a detrimental effect to the running systems; for example, there are attributes in the conceptual model that accept multiple values.  If incorrect values are included, the systems MAY suffer.

Many aspects of GLUE provide service discovery.  Inserting false information would allow unauthorised services to publish their presence and attract activity.  This MAY be used as a basis for further attacks. Underlying concrete models and software implementations should ensure that any agent's ability to insert information is limited and appropriate.



        1.  Deletion

The ability to delete information from an information service could interfere with normal operations; for example, if Services are removed then activity that would use those services MAY be affected; if AdminDomains are removed then normal operation procedures MAY be impossible; if security components are removed (such as X509 certificates) then facilities such as non-repudiation MAY become ineffectual. Underlying concrete models and implementing software should ensure that any ability of an agent to delete information is limited and appropriate.



        1.  Modification

The ability for an agent to modify information stored in an information service is key to providing accurate information. However, concrete data models and software implementation should place limits such that the agents' ability to modify information is controlled and appropriate.



        1.  Man-in-the-middle

For a system implementing the GLUE conceptual model, a successful man-in-the-middle attack MAY lead to arbitrary modification of data (see 9.4.5).  It MAY also allow deleting existing data (see 9.4.4) or adding additional data (see 9.4.3).  This MAY have severe influence on the systems based on GLUE information. Underlying concrete models and implementing software should understand the risk from man-in-the-middle attacks and provide appropriate security against them.



        1.  Denial of service attacks

A Denial of Service attack is one that attempts to prevent normal operation of systems.  Perhaps, the most obvious is to prevent or corrupt the flow of information. Systems using the GLUE conceptual model should understand the consequences of a partial or complete lack of information. Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure the systems continue to run to the extent possible.

1.  **Place-holder values for unknown data**

Whilst people endeavor to provide accurate information, there MAY be situations where specific GLUE attributes MAY be assigned place-holder (or dummy) values.  These place-holder values carry some additional semantic meaning; specifically, that the correct value is currently unknown and the presented value should be ignored.  This appendix describes a set of such place-holder values.

Some attributes within the GLUE schema are required whilst others are optional.  If the attribute is optional and the corresponding information is unavailable, the information provider MUST either publish a place-holder or not to publish the attribute.  If the attribute is required, then the information MUST either publish a place-holder value or refrain from publishing the GLUE object.

If a place-holder value is published, it MUST conform to the scheme described in this appendix.  This is to increase the likelihood that software will understand the nature of the information it receives.

This appendix describes place-holder values that have be chosen so they are obvious "wrong" to humans, unlikely to occur under normal operation and valid within the attribute type.  This also allows for detection of failing information provider components.



    1.  **Use cases**

There are two principle use-cases for place-holder values, although others MAY exist.

Scenario 1. a static value has no good default value and has not been configured for a particular site.

Some provisions for GLUE Schema provide templates.  These templates MAY contain attributes that have no good default value; for example, supplying the correct value MAY require site-specific knowledge. Whilst it is expected that these attributes be configured, it is possible that this does not happen, so exposing the attributes' default values.

Scenario 2. information provider is unable to obtain a dynamic value.

A dynamic value is provided by an information provider by querying the underlying grid resources.  This query will use a number of ancillary resources (e.g., DNS, network hardware) that might fail; the grid services might also fail.  If an attribute is required and the current value is unobtainable, a place-holder value MUST be used.



    1.  **Place-holder values**

This section describes a number of values that MAY be represented within a given address space (e.g., Strings/UTF-8, Integers, FQDNs, IPv4 address space).  Each of the different types are introduced along with the place-holder value and a brief discussion on usage, rational and any other considerations.



    1.  **Extended booleans**

The reserved value "undefined" SHOULD be used. The way to express that no value is published MUST be defined in the documents defining the realization to concrete data models (e.g., [GLUE-REAL]).



    1.  **Simple strings**

 (ASCII/UTF-8) should use "UNDEFINEDVALUE" or should start "UNDEFINEDVALUE:"

Upper-case letters make it easier to spot and a single word avoids any white-space issues.

A short error message MAY be incorporated into the message by appending the message after the colon.

  Examples:

    UNDEFINEDVALUE

    UNDEFINEDVALUE: unable to contact torque daemon.

Using UNDEFINEDVALUE is a default option for strings that have no widely-known structure.  If a value is of a more restrictive sub-type (e.g., FQDNs, FQANs, URIs) described below, then the rules for more restrictive form MUST be used.



    1.  **Fully qualified domain names**

They MUST use a hostname ending either "example.org" for scenario 1, or "invalid" for scenario 2.

RFC 2606 defines two second-level domains: "example.org" and "example.com".  These domains have the advantage of ending with a recognisable TLD, so are recognisable as a DNS name.  Default configuration (scenario 1, above) MUST use DNS names that end "example.org"

RFC 2606 also reserves the "invalid" Top-Level-Domain (TLD) as always invalid and clearly so.  For dynamic information gathering, a value ending "invalid" MUST be used.

In both cases, additional information MAY be included by specifying a prefix to "example.org" or "invalid". This MAY be used to specify the class of machine that should be present.  For dynamic

infomation, if the class of machine is not published then the FQDN "unknown.invalid" MUST be used.

Examples:

www.example.org

your-CE.example.org

unknown.invalid

site-local-BDII.invalid



    1.  **IPv4 address**

It MUST use 192.0.2.250

There are several portions of IPv4 addresses that should not appear on a network, but none that are reserved for documentation or to specify a non-existent address. Using any address leads to the risk of side-effects, should this value be used.

The best option is an IP address from the 192.0.2.0/24 subnet.  This subnet is defined in RFC 3330 as "TEST-NET" for use in documentation and example code.  For consistency, the value 192.0.2.250 MUST be used.



    1.  **IPv6 addr**

It MUST use 2001:DB8::FFFF

There is no documented undefined IPv6 address.  RFC 3849 reserves the address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 for documentation.  For consistency, the address 2001:DB8::FFFF MUST be used.



    1.  **Integers **

It MUST use "all nines"

		For uint32/int32 this is 999,999,999

		For uint64/int64 this is 999,999,999,999,999,999

For integers, all numbers expressible within the encoding (int32/uint32/etc.) are valid so there is no safe choice.

If an unsigned integer is encoded as a signed integer, it is possible to use negative numbers safely.  However, these numbers will be unrepresentable if the number is stored as an unsigned

integer.  For this reason a negative number place-holder MUST not be used.

The number was chosen for three reasons.  First, attribute scales are often chosen to reduce the likelihood of overflow: numbers towards MAXINT (the large number representable in an integer domain) are less likely to appear.  Second, repeated numbers stand out more clearly to humans.  Finally, the statistical frequency of measured values often follows Benford's law, which indicates that numbers starting with "1" occur far more frequently than those starting with "9" (about six times more likely).  For these reasons, information providers MUST use all-nines to indicate a `place-holder`.  



    1.  **File path**

It MUST start either "/UNDEFINEDPATH" or "\UNDEFINEDPATH".

As with the simple string, a single upper-case word is recommended. The initial slash indicates that the value is a path. Implementations MUST use whichever slash is most appropriate for the underlying system (Unix-like systems use a forward-slash). Software should accept either value as an unknown-value place-holder. 

Additional information MAY be encoded as data beyond the initial UNDEFINEDPATH, separated by the same slash as started the value. Additional comments should not use any of the following characters: \ [ ] ; = " : | , * .

Examples:

    /UNDEFINEDPATH

    \UNDEFINEDPATH

    /UNDEFINEDPATH/Path to storage area

    /UNDEFINEDPATH/Broker unavailable



    1.  **Email addresses**

It MUST use an undefined FQDN for the domain.

RFC 2822 defines emails addresses to have the form: &lt;local-part> '@' &lt;domain>

The &lt;domain> MUST be an undefined FQDN; see above for a complete description.  For email addresses, information providers should use "example.org" for scenario 1. and "unknown.invalid" for scenario 2.

The &lt;local-part> MAY be used to encode a small amount of additional information; for example, it MAY indicate the class of user to whom the email address should be delivered.  If no such information is to be encoded the value "user" MUST be used.

Examples:

    user@example.org

    user@unknown.invalid

    site-local-contact@example.org

    local-admin@example.org



    1.  **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**

It is schema-specific

RFC 3986 defines URIs as a "federated and extensible naming system." All URIs start with a schema-name part (e.g., "http") and no schema-name has been reserved for undefined or documenting example values.

For any given URI schema ("http", for example), it MAY be possible to define a place-holder value within that name-space.  If a GLUE value has only one valid schema, the undefined value MUST be taken from that schema. If several schemata are possible, one MUST be chosen from the available options.  This should be the most commonly used.

Take care with the URI encoding.  All place-holder URI values MUST be valid URIs.  If additional information is included, it MUST be encoded so the resulting URI is valid.

For schemata that MAY include a FQDN (e.g., a reference to an Internet host), an undefined URI MUST use an undefined FQDN; see above for details on undefined FQDNs.

URI schemata that reference a remote data object (e.g., "http", "ftp", "https"), additional information MAY be included as the path.  The FQDN indicates that the value is a place-holder, indicating an place-holder value, so information providers should not specify "UNDEFINEDPATH".

For "file" URIs, the path part MUST identify the value as unknown and MUST use the forward-slash variant; see above for details on undefined paths.

For "mailto" URIs (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2368.txt) encapsulates valid email addresses with additional information (such as email headers and message body). Place-holder mailto URIs MUST use an unknown email address (see above). Any additional information MUST be included in the email body.

There MAY be other schemata in use that are not explicitly covered in this section.  A place-holder value should be agreed upon within whichever domain such schemata are used.  This place-holder value should be in the spirit of the place-holder values described so far.

Examples:

    http://www.example.org/

    httpg://your-CE.example.org/path/to/end-point

    httpg://unknown.invalid/User%20certificate%20has%20expired

    mailto:site-admin@example.org

    mailto:user@maildomain.invalid?body=Problem%20connecting%20to%20WLMS

    file:///UNDEFINEDPATH

    file:///UNDEFINEDPATH/path%20to%20some%20directory



    1.  **X.509 Distinguished Names**

It MUST start O=Grid,CN=UNDEFINEDUSER

X.509 uses a X.500 namespace, represented as several Relative Domain-Names (RDNs) concatenated by commas (we refer to syntax defined in IETF RFC 4514).  The final RDN is usually a single common name (CN), although multiple CNs are allowed.

Unknown DN values MUST have at least two entries: an initial O=Grid followed immediately by CN=UNDEFINEDUSER.

Additional information MAY be encoded using extra CN entries.  These MUST come after CN=UNDEFINEDUSER.

Examples:

    O=Grid,CN=UNDEFINEDUSER

    O=Grid,CN=UNDEFINEDUSER/CN=Your Grid certificate DN here

    O=Grid,CN=UNDEFINEDUSER/CN=Cannot access SE



    1.  **Fully Qualified Attribute Name (FQAN)**

It MUST use a VO of "vo.example.org" (for scenario 1.) or "unknown.invalid" (for scenario 2).

The "VOMS Credential Format" document,

http://edg-wp2.web.cern.ch/edg-wp2/security/voms/edg-voms-credential.pdf

states that FQANs MUST have the form:

/VO[/group[/subgroup(s)]][/Role=role][/Capability=cap]

Where VO is a well-formed FQDN.  Unlike FQDNs, VO names MUST be lower-case.  The place-holder value for FQAN is derived from the place-holder FQDN (see Section A.5).  It MUST have no subgroup(s) or Capability specified.

Any additional information MUST be encoded within a single Role name.  Care should be taken that only valid characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and dash) are included.

Examples:

    /vo.example.org

    /vo.example.org/Role=Replace-this-example-with-your-FQAN

    /unknown.invalid

    /unknown.invalid/Role=Unable-to-contact-CE-Error-42



    1.  **Geographic locations**

It MUST use longitude 0 degrees, latitude 0 degrees.

Meridians of longitude are taken from (-180,180] degrees, whilst parallels of latitude are taken from [-90,90] degrees.  For a place-holder value to be a valid location, it MUST also be taken from these ranges.

By a happy coincidence, the (0,0) location is within the Atlantic Ocean, some 380 miles (611 kilometers) south of the nearest country (Ghana).  Since this location is unlikely to be used and repeated numbers are easier for humans to spot, (0,0) MUST be used to specify an place-holder location.





1.  **Data Types**

This section contains the definition of attribute types defined within this model. The enumerated types may be either closed or open. For properties whose type defines a closed enumeration, one of the defined values MUST be chosen; any other value is not valid. For properties whose type defines an open enumeration, one of the defined values MAY be chosen, but nevertheless any other value compatible with the string type and with the recommended syntax is allowed. Before defining a new open enumeration value, it is recommended to apply the "GLUE2 Enumerations procedures and best practices" ([http://redmine.ogf.org/projects/glue-wg/wiki/Enumerations_procedures_and_best_practices_v10](http://redmine.ogf.org/projects/glue-wg/wiki/Enumerations_procedures_and_best_practices_v10)).The enumeration values MUST be lower-case.

   </td>
   <td>GridSite Access Control List
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


A policy scheme is defined by a syntax for rules and by a matching algorithm defining how a string MAY be matched against the published rules. For the _basic_ policy scheme, the following syntax MUST be used (defined in EBNF form [EBNF]):



*   BASIC RULE ::= ( DN_NAME | VO_NAME | 'ALL' )
*   DN_RULE ::= 'dn:' DN_NAME 
*   VO_RULE ::= 'vo:' [a-zA-Z0-9-_\.]+
*   DN_NAME ::=

As a matching algorithm, the basic scheme adopts the exact match (if at least one rule provides an exact match or the rule 'ALL' is present, then the subject is authorized to be mapped into the related share). More complex policy schemes SHOULD be defined in profile documents. 

Examples of policies expressed using the basic syntax are:



*   `dn:/C=XX/O=YYYY/OU=Personal Certificate/L=ZZZZ/CN=NAME SURNAME`
    *   matches the user proving to have a certificate identified by this DN
*   `vo:/vo_a `
    *   matches all the users proving to be part of the vo_a
